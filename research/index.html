<p>Our overarching goal is to understand our changing environment and contribute to building resilient infrastructure for the future. At the RHyCAM Lab, we take a dual approach: as scientists, we develop innovative tools—combining observations, atmospheric reanalysis, physical modeling, and artificial intelligence—to study hydroclimate extremes like storms, floods, snowmelt, and wildfires. We investigate their historical patterns and project their future behavior. As engineers, we integrate these scientific insights with engineering protocols to improve design practices, aiming for safer infrastructure and a more sustainable world. By bridging research and real-world applications, we ensure our work supports a prepared and resilient society.</p>

<p>Here are some scientific themes that we currently work on:</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Historical and Future Hydroclimate Extremes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Investigate the historical trends and variability of hydroclimate extremes (e.g., storms, floods, snowmelt, wildfires) using observational data, reanalysis, and modeling.</li>
  <li>Project future changes in these extremes under different climate scenarios to assess risks and inform adaptation strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Developing Advanced Modeling Frameworks</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Conduct high-resolution regional climate simulations to better capture hydroclimate processes and extremes.</li>
  <li>Integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of atmospheric and hydrologic models.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exploring the Water Cycle in a Changing Climate</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Study the impacts of climate change on the water cycle, including precipitation patterns, snowpack dynamics, and river flow regimes.</li>
  <li>Quantify the role of atmospheric rivers and other large-scale weather systems in driving regional hydroclimate variability.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Enhancing Predictability of Hydroclimate Extremes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Develop predictive tools to forecast extreme events (e.g., floods, wildfires) with longer lead times and higher accuracy.</li>
  <li>Investigate the role of local and remote sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in modulating hydroclimate extremes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quantifying Uncertainty in Hydroclimate Projections</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Develop frameworks to quantify and reduce uncertainties in climate and hydrological models.</li>
  <li>Use probabilistic approaches to assess the likelihood of extreme events and their potential impacts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>High-resolution extreme events and climate modeling</strong> We have been using a hiarchy of global and regional climate models to simulate  but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.</p>

<p>We also work to convert these knowledge into engineering language, helping sector users and policymakers to digest and incorporate these information.</p>

<p><strong>Improving Infrastructure Design for Climate Resilience</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Translate scientific insights into updated engineering protocols for infrastructure design, focusing on resilience to hydroclimate extremes.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with stakeholders to develop actionable guidelines for flood control, wildfire management, and water resource planning.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bridging Science and Policy for Sustainable Solutions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Work with policymakers and stakeholders to co-develop science-based strategies for climate adaptation and mitigation.</li>
  <li>Assess the socio-economic impacts of hydroclimate extremes and identify pathways for building resilient communities.</li>
</ul>
